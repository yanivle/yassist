Note: When the PSM is not specified, it defaults to 3 in the command line

and python versions, but to 6 in the C++ API. If you are not getting the
same results using the command line version and the C++ API, explicitly
set the PSM.

2.1. Command Line Usage

The examples below show how to perform OCR using tesseract command
line tool. The language is chosen to be English and the OCR engine mode is
set to 1 (i.e. LSTM only ).

# Output to terminal

tesseract image.jpg stdout -1 eng --oem 1 --psm 3
# Output to output.txt

tesseract image.jpg output -l eng --oem 1 --psm 3

2.2. Using pytesseract

In Python, we use the pytesseract module. It is simply a wrapper around the
command line tool with the command line options specified using the config
argument. The basic usage requires us to first read the image using OpenCV
and pass the image to image_to_string method of the pytesseract class
along with the language (eng).

import cv2
import sys
import pytesseract
